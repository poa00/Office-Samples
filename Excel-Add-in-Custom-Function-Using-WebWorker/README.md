### Run the add-in using Office Add-ins Development Kit extension

We recommend you try this sample by using the [Office Add-ins Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msoffice.microsoft-office-add-in-debugger). The Office Add-ins Development Kit is an end-to-end developer tool for building Office add-ins. It helps create, run, and debug an Office Add-in.

1. **Download the sample code**

   To download this sample code, either:
   * Open the Office Add-ins Development Kit extension and view samples in the **Sample gallery**. Select the **Create** button in the top-right corner of the sample page.
   * [Clone](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository or download this sample to a folder on your computer. Then, open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
   
1. **Open the Office Add-ins Development Kit**
    
    Select the <img src="./assets/Icon_Office_Add-ins_Development_Kit.png" width="30" alt="Office Add-ins Development Kit"/> icon in the **Activity Bar** to open the extension.

1. **Preview Your Office Add-in (F5)**

    Select **Preview Your Office Add-in(F5)** to launch the add-in and debug the code. In the drop down menu, select the option **Desktop (Edge Chromium)**.

    <img src="./assets/devkit_preview.png" width="500" alt="Screenshot shows Preview your Office add-in in Office Add-ins Development Kit"/>

    The extension then checks that the prerequisites are met before debugging starts. Check the terminal for detailed information if there are issues with your environment. After this process, the Excel desktop application launches and opens a new workbook with the sample add-in.

1. **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in**

    Once you are finished testing and debugging the add-in, select **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in**. This closes the web server and removes the add-in from the registry and cache.

## Use the sample add-in

1. Click the executeCFWithoutWebWorker button, a CustomFunction without WebWorker will be instered into the 'A1' Cell and executed, and the ball inside the taskpane will be blocked.
2. Click the executeCFWithWebWorker button, a CustomFunction with WebWorker will be instered into the 'A1' Cell and executed, and the ball inside the taskpane will not be blocked.

Now you can use the following custom functions:

```
=WebWorkerSample.TEST(2)
=WebWorkerSample.TEST_PROMISE(2)
=WebWorkerSample.TEST_ERROR(2)
=WebWorkerSample.TEST_ERROR_PROMISE(2)
=WebWorkerSample.TEST_UI_THREAD(2)
```

If you open the task pane you will see an animated bouncing ball. You can see the effect of blocking the UI thread by entering `=WebWorkerSample.TEST_UI_THREAD(50000)` into a cell. The bouncing ball will stop for a few seconds while the result is calculated.

## Details

### Dispatch to web worker

When a custom function needs to use a web worker, we turn the calculation into a job and dispatch it to a web worker. The **dispatchCalculationJob** function takes the function name and parameters from a custom function, and creates a job object that is posted to a web worker. For more details see the **dispatchCalculationJob** function in [functions.js](functions.js).

```JavaScript
    // Post a job to the web worker to do the calculation
    function dispatchCalculationJob(functionName, parameters) {
        const jobId = g_nextJobId++;
        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
            // store the promise information.
            g_jobIdToPromiseInfoMap[jobId] = {resolve: resolve, reject: reject};
            const worker = getOrCreateWebWorker(jobId);
            worker.postMessage({
                jobId: jobId,
                name: functionName,
                parameters: parameters
            });
        });
    }
```

### Web worker runs the job and returns the result

The web worker runs the job specified in the job object to do the actual calculation. The web worker code is in a separate file in [functions-worker.js](functions-worker.js).

The functions-worker.js will:

1. Receive a message containing the job to run.
1. Invoke a function to perform the calculation.
1. Call **postMessage** to post the result back to the main thread.

```JavaScript
self.addEventListener('message',
    function(event) {
        let data = event.data;
        if (typeof(data) == "string") {
            data = JSON.parse(data);
        }

        const jobId = data.jobId;
        try {
            const result = invokeFunction(data.name, data.parameters);
            // check whether the result is a promise
            if (typeof(result) == "function" || typeof(result) == "object" && typeof(result.then) == "function") {
                result.then(function(realResult) {
                    postMessage(
                        {
                            jobId: jobId,
                            result: realResult
                        }
                    );
                })
                .catch(function(ex) {
                    postMessage(
                        {
                            jobId: jobId,
                            error: true
                        }
                    )
                });
            }
            else {
                postMessage({
                    jobId: jobId,
                    result: result
                });
            }
        }
        catch(ex) {
            postMessage({
                jobId: jobId,
                error: true
            });
        }
    }
);

```

Most of the previous code handles the error case and Promise case.

### Process results from the web worker

In [functions.js](functions.js), when a new web worker is created, it is provided a callback function to process the result. The callback function parses the data to determine the outcome of the job. It resolves or rejects the promise as determined by the job result data.

```JavaScript
        // create a new web worker
        const webWorker = new Worker("functions-worker.js");
        webWorker.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
            let data = event.data;
            if (typeof(data) == "string") {
                data = JSON.parse(data);
            }

            if (typeof(data.jobId) == "number") {
                const jobId = data.jobId;
                // get the promise info associated with the job id
                const promiseInfo = g_jobIdToPromiseInfoMap[jobId];
                if (promiseInfo) {
                    if (data.error) {
                        // The web worker returned an error
                        promiseInfo.reject(new Error());
                    }
                    else {
                        // The web worker returned a result
                        promiseInfo.resolve(data.result);
                    }
                    delete g_jobIdToPromiseInfoMap[jobId];
                }
            }
        });
```
